=====================================
Open Sharding Protocol Driver Installation
=====================================

The installation of the Open Sharding Protocol for MySQl can be executed with the ruby script build.rb. This Script will compile and package the neccesary libraries for use with dbshards.


----Executing Build.rb---------

Executing build.rb format. 

ruby build.rb [options arguments] [mysql version(5.0 or 5.1)]

Executing build.rb be can be carried out with the following steps. 

$ ruby build.rb build 5.0
* This command will build the myosp libraries for the mysql version 5.0 assuming build-real has been executed.

$ ruby build.rb build 5.1 
* This command will build the myosp libraries for the mysql version 5.1 assuming build-real has been executed.

$ ruby build.rb build-real [5.0 or 5.1]
* This command will install all the depencies for the actual build of myosp, if this has not 
* been executed before, the build option will fail. This only has to be executed once. This will also build the mysql
*libraries with the _real extension for MyOSP use. 

$ ruby build.rb install-mysql [5.0 or 5.1]
* This command will actually install the mysql software if it has been previously called with build-real.
* This is not a requirement for the actual build of MyOSP.


-------Installing the MyOSP Driver--------

In order for proper installation. The myosp package should be placed in the /usr/lib64/myosp or /usr/lib/myosp depending on what system. 

$ mkdir /usr/lib64/myosp 
* This is for any x86_64 architecture system excluding ubuntu.

$ mkdir /usr/lib/myosp
* This is for any i386 architectures and all Ubuntu systems.

In the directory created above, untar the myosp build package, 

$ tar xvfz [myosp-build-package]
* This will untar the svn export package.

$ ruby setup.rb 
* This script will actually place the config files in the desired location as well as creating the ldconfig
* script for myosp. 

NOTE: Do not forget to edit the myosp.conf file. This file is necessary for myosp to work correctly, it can be found in the /etc/osp/ directory created from the setup.rb.
