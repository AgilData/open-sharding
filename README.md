Open Sharding Project

The Open Sharding project is an initiative to provide a high-performance, standardized architecture access for 
application architects and developers to the capabilities of Database Sharding. Database Sharding is a proven technology for 
shared-nothing partitioning of databases across multiple servers, allowing unlimited scalability and performance. 
Open Sharding components are DBMS and vendor agnostic, in that they can operate with any DBMS, including: 
traditional SQL relational databases, NoSQL databases, in-memory engines, even custom database engines that you build your self. 
You can also use Open Sharding compatible database sharding components from any vendor components that supports the 
[Open Sharding Protocol](https://github.com/AgilData/open-sharding/wiki/Open-Sharding-Protocol).

To learn what Open Sharding is all about, a good place to start is the Open Sharding Architecture.

The key components of the Open Sharding Project are the [Open Sharding Protocol](https://github.com/AgilData/open-sharding/wiki/Open-Sharding-Protocol)
and open source Open Sharding Drivers. Open Sharding is designed to allow easy, consistent access to Database Sharding technologies. 

This project has two public repositories:
* Source/SVN: This repository is used for obtaining binary builds of Open Sharding components.
* Source/Git: The [Git repository](https://github.com/AgilData/open-sharding/) contains open source Open Sharding source code, allowing developers to build the components themselves, or just browse the source.

The [Wiki](https://github.com/AgilData/open-sharding/wiki) contains basic documentation for the project. If you do not find the answers you need, you can email: info@open-sharding.org.
