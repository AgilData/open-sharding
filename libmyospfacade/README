libmyosp

Build

Run the build.rb script. This will create the following libraries in the ./libs directory and will also create
a tarball of these files as well as the libopensharding.so from ../libopensharding

libmyosp.so.15
libmyosp_r.so.15
libmyosp.so.16
libmyosp_r.so.16

These libraries mimic libmysqlclient.so and at runtime dynamically load a version of the original libmysqlclient with
the so name and filename libmysqlclient_real.so.

Note that it is not advisable to simply set up symlinks called libmysqlclient_real.so to link to the original
libmysqlclient since this requires setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH and ldconfig will delete or change symlinks.
