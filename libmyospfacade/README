libmyosp

Build

Run the build.rb script. This will create the following libraries in the ./libs directory and will also create
a tarball of these files as well as the libopensharding.so from ../libopensharding

libmyosp.so.15
libmyosp_r.so.15
libmyosp.so.16
libmyosp_r.so.16

Install

Here is how MyOSP configuration with ldconfig works:
- The libmyosp libraries are installed in /usr/lib64/myosp (for Ubuntu and Debian /usr/lib/myosp)
- The package includes libmysqlclient_real_r.so.16.0.0
-- This is a build of the actual MySQL client library, with the library name modified to include _real
- Add a file for ldconfig to recognize myosp as a priority library
-- /etc/ld.so.conf.d/myosp.conf
-- The contents of the file are:
--- /usr/lib64/myosp (or /usr/lib/myosp)
- Run ldconfig
- All links are automatically created in /usr/lib64/myosp
