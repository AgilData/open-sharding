# Control system logging for Open Sharding Protocol (OSP) drivers. 
# If an application has a log4j.xml in its classpath, it will use that file for logging control.
# Otherwise this file should be in the classpath of the application.

# Specify a log file (including the path). If no log.file is specified, logging goes to STDOUT.
log.file=/var/log/ospdriver/system.log

# JDBC OSP driver
# Valid logging levels are: INFO|DEBUG|TRACE
org.opensharding.jdbc=INFO

# Optionally configure Shard Analyze logging.

# If set to true, the driver will generate a shard analyze log. 
# A shard analyze log can be generated with any mode or OSP driver type.
# Note that the shard analyze log creates a log entry for every API call made by the driver,
# therefore this should only be run in a test environment, as performance is adversely affected.

# If set to true, the driver will log data values.

# Directory to write the shard analyze logs. Defaults to current working directory.

# Maximum size in bytes of a single shard analyze log file. Defaults to 10MB.

# Maximum number of shard analyze log files to generate. Defaults to 100. 
shard.analyze.log.maxfiles=100

# Maximum number of hours to run the logging driver. 0 indicates no limit.
